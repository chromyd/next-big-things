Repository of ideas what to do next

## FICS App
The Free Internet Chess Server (FICS) is a great service but none of the apps out there is perfect (see http://freechess.org/interfaces.html).

### Mission Statement
Develop the most popular mobile app for the FICS.

### TODOs
- [x] the name of the game

### Top Features
- easy (automatic) login and reconnect
- timestamping
- automatic seek requests
- automatic light/dark mode
- reliable and **cancelable** premove
- intuitive chat system (chat w/ opponents, message if offline, ...)
- moods:
  - infinite play (auto seek after each game) w/ "Pause" button
  - greeting and handshake messages

### Top Goals
- same experience on iOS and Android
- optimized for phones and tablets alike
- sweet and fresh UX experience
- strong user relationship
  - feedback channel
  - feature requests
  - feature voting
  - aim to provide "no bullshit interface": just what the users need, no more, no less

### Features to Vote For
- tournaments
- country of origin next to player's name
- basically everything else from the Out-of-Scope list below (except bughouse)
  
### Out of Scope
- bughouse
- suicide, atomic, ... (because of premove)
- observing games
- lectures
- problem chess
